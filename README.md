# Module 19 Challenge: Using Unsupervised Learning Models to Cluster Crypto Currency Data

## Using KMeans and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to Optimize Cryptocurrency Price Change Data


## Introduction
This script generates summary statistics and uses unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize clustering of Crypto currencies based on 24hr, 7day, 14day, 30day, 60day, 200day and 1year price change data.


## Usage
- Run the script in the [Crypto_Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/zmoloci/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb) to view the models
- k-value ranges, random_state and K-Means n_clusters can be adjusted to further explore/optimize clustering.
